Whenever you get into something new, be it a blog platform or a new phone, you face making a decision. There is a science behind decision-making and quite some helpful advice circulates on the web. Despite all that, it is a hard thing to do and I will share some of the experience that ultimately made decision making easier for me. This write-up will add some helpful advise and will not contribute to science at all.

## The problem with decisions

Some people argue that humans are not particularly good at making decisions. It is true that we tend be biased for various reasons: wikipedia lists [18 different biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making#Cognitive_and_personal_biases) we might have. As it stands, humans are still the best thing we have for making decisions. Although some stock-picking monkeys might beg to differ.

To be honest, I did get lost more than once while making choices. Bloggers present competing arguments, wikipedia provides feature comparisons and websites promise to get you started in 3 minutes. The choice becomes a dilemma to the point where you envy people who know of no other blogging platform than Wordpress or no other phone than an iPhone. After getting into an ‘analysis paralysis’ with: a programming language, a web framework, a database engine, various libraries and finally a blogging platform I felt it was time to apply some reflection and method.

## Applying self-reflection

Having established the suspicion that I am not a great decision-maker, it is time for reflection. That slightly uncomfortable process that leads to self improvement.

It turns out that I am mainly stuck at new things to make, learn or pick up. These decisions can all be said to be highly reversible.

In fact most decisions we take are to a degree reversible: even a new job, a marriage or a move to another country. Although we, or at least I, don’t really like to think of it that way. I am somehow more inclined to ‘follow my heart’ with these kind of choices. This might be a euphemism for potentially foregoing the best rational decision in favor of an easier decision-making process. Anyway, it has worked for me so far.

As far as new stuff is concerned, by nature I tend to get pretty excited to pick it up. I look at all the internet sources, all the parameters. There is not actually much method or preparation involved. I try and get the best possible sense of all alternatives and the possibilities they offer, without setting time restraints or documenting the process.

When I have a good feel what would work for me, I decide to stick with that. I tend to value the following highly: what new superpowers capabilities will it give me; how easy is it to learn; how convincing are the critics.

After making a choice, it feels like a decision that I identify with. I feel a need to justify my choice: to myself and in a lesser degree to others. My choice has become part of me. The various programming language flamewars and the disputes between Apple and PC fans indicate that I am not alone in this regard.

In summary, this is my current and flawed method of decision-making:

1. Study everything.
1. Try and make the best possible choice.
1. Defend the choice.

# Time to apply a method

This is what I took away from the self-reflection; my renewed algorithm for decision making:

1. Explain the expectations.
1. Explain the alternatives.
1. Make any choice and get to work.
1. Explain why you made the wrong decision.

The idea of using this algorithm-style is borrowed from the physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who used it to describe Richard Feynman’s method of problem-solving:

1. Write down the problem.
1. Think very hard.
1. Write down the solution.

At first glance it might seem like a bit of joke, but there is a lot of merit in it (as in lots of jokes actually). It is worth noting that both gentlemen are Nobel laureates. By actually putting a problem or solution to words, you are forced to explain it to yourself.

Explaining helps understanding. We all knew this intuitively and recently this was backed up by [scientific research](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/joseph/WilliamsLombrozoRehder.pdf). Explaining is a big part of my decision-making algorithm. You could explain to yourself, to a friend or to an anonymous crowd. Not much difference between them, but my guess is that a friend would provide the best feedback out of the three.

### step 1: Explain the expectations

This step might be the biggest break from how I used to operate. Remember I used to ‘dive right in’. Now, containing my enthusiasm and putting the problems and expectations to words:

* provides a formal starting point: let’s initiate decision-making mode!
* keeps focus on the problem and provides parameters to evaluate the alternatives.
* provides a framework to make the choice or to get back to when it needs adjusting.

### step 2: Explain the alternatives

First identify the alternatives and then briefly explain them by their strengths and weaknesses. The previous step helps keep you focus on what counts and what is irrelevant. The trick here is not to let yourself be guided by opinions and comparisons. Look up additional information just to support the explanation.

Some of the better known decision-making techniques involve listing the parameters and scoring them for all alternatives, using pluses and minuses or weighted grades. The winner being the choice with most pluses or the highest cumulative grade. I feel this invariably dumbs down the parameters and offers a false sense of validation. It has more use as a justification of a prior choice or for [simple optimization sold as decision-making](http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/irudowsky/MIS/PlugIn/PlugInT04.pdf). In the end of the day I prefer a solid explanation over a spreadsheet.

### step 3: Make any choice and get to work

This is the good bit. Just skip over the formal decision making and trying to weigh off in what regards one alternative is better than others. The previous steps will give you enough context to pick a favorite right away.

The time saved here is best spent on getting your hands dirty on the solution you picked. Be careful not to judge too much on how much you can get done quickly. Rather try and spend some time evaluating the versatility and the quality of the documentation and the community. Those factors will count in the long run.

### step 4: Explain why you made the wrong decision

This step is to a degree tongue-in-cheek: let’s hope you made the right decision right away. If not: nothing is lost and you can get back to step 3, 2 or even 1 depending on why you got it wrong.

Incorporating ‘failure’ in the process helps not becoming too attached to your choice and explaining why it was wrong helps you to learn from mistakes.

# Cheating in the process

Following these guidelines will most likely not get you to the *perfect* solution for a given choice. And that sounds about right, because trying to have the perfect solution is often where the dilemma of choice starts.

It is rather a highly pragmatic method that probably will give you the tool you can use for your needs. A tool is just a means to an end and if it does not work for you, just throw it away. I advise you not to apply this decision-making algorithm when trying to choose a new car, but it will work for a surprising amount of choices that concern programming: languages, web-platforms, blog platforms, hosting providers, libraries etc.

It feels like cheating on decision-making by making the decision less ‘definitive’ and less ‘decision-like’. It works for me and I hope it works for you.
